#Smart Cap Project
Overview
The Smart Cap is an innovative assistive technology designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings by providing real-time descriptions of their environment. The project utilizes image processing and natural language processing techniques to capture images and narrate them aloud, enabling users to gain awareness of their surroundings.

##Features

###Image Capture: Utilizes a webcam to capture images of the environment.

###Image Captioning: Employs a pretrained model (e.g., BLIP) to generate descriptive captions for the captured images.

###Text-to-Speech: Converts the generated captions into audio using multilingual support.

###Raspberry Pi Integration: The system is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi for portability.

###User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind for easy operation.

##Technologies Used

###Image Processing: Libraries like OpenCV to capture and process images.

###Natural Language Processing: Hugging Face's Transformers for image captioning.

###Text-to-Speech: gTTS and Mozilla TTS for audio output.

###Audio Playback: Pygame for playback of generated audio.

###Hardware: Raspberry Pi as the computing platform.

##Installation

1.###Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-cap.git
   cd smart-cap

2.###Install required dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.###Set up the webcam and ensure it is recognized by your Raspberry Pi.

4.###Run the application:
   python main.py

##Usage:
->After running the application, the webcam captures images at regular intervals.
->The generated captions are read aloud through the connected audio output.
->Users can adjust settings (e.g., language preference) through the configuration file.
