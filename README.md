Smart Cap Project
Overview
The Smart Cap is an innovative assistive technology designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings by providing real-time descriptions of their environment. The project utilizes image processing and natural language processing techniques to capture images and narrate them aloud, enabling users to gain awareness of their surroundings. By integrating state-of-the-art AI models and hardware, the Smart Cap aims to enhance the quality of life for visually impaired users.

Features
Image Capture: Utilizes a webcam to capture images of the environment.
Image Captioning: Employs a pretrained model (e.g., BLIP) to generate descriptive captions for the captured images, allowing users to understand what is in front of them.
Text-to-Speech: Converts the generated captions into audio using multilingual support, ensuring accessibility for users speaking different languages.
Raspberry Pi Integration: The system is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, making it portable and easy to use in various environments.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, enabling users to easily operate the system with minimal setup.
Technologies Used
Image Processing: Utilizes libraries like OpenCV to capture images from a webcam and process them for analysis.
Natural Language Processing: Uses Hugging Face's Transformers library for image captioning, providing contextually relevant descriptions.
Text-to-Speech: Integrates gTTS and Mozilla TTS for audio output, supporting a variety of languages to cater to diverse user needs.
Audio Playback: Utilizes Pygame for playback of generated audio, ensuring smooth audio experiences for users.
Hardware: Raspberry Pi serves as the computing platform, ensuring portability and ease of integration into daily life.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/adithyaa-s/smartcap
cd smart-cap
Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the webcam and ensure it is recognized by your Raspberry Pi.
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
After running the application, the webcam will capture images at regular intervals.
The generated captions will be read aloud through the connected audio output.
Users can adjust settings (e.g., language preference) through the configuration file.
